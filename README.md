# KD2_Music_Generation_LSTM

Second homework for *Knowledge Discovery* Course of MSc in Data Science for Management, University of Catania.

The objective of this work is to build a LSTM model, consisting of 1 layer, to perform music generation.

The dataset I created is the midi_data which cointains two folders, one for each genre:
*  blues 
*  pop

You can download it and try to implement my code on Google Colab!
